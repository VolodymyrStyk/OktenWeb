      Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in
      the Solar System, being larger than only Mercury. In English, Mars carries
      the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the "Red
      Planet".

    <p>
      The days and seasons are comparable to those of Earth, because the
      rotational period as well as the tilt of the rotational axis relative to
      the ecliptic plane are similar. Mars is the site of Olympus Mons, the
      largest volcano and highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar
      System, and of Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the Solar
      System.
